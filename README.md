# Smart-Fish-Tank-with-automated-feede

This project involves the design and implementation of a Smart Fish Tank with the following innovative features:

  ⬜ Day-Night Simulation: An LED panel is used to simulate day and night cycles, creating a natural environment for the fish.
  ⬜ Automated Fish Feeder: Automatically dispenses food at scheduled intervals, ensuring the fish are fed regularly and consistently.
  ⬜ Water Visibility Measurement: Utilizes a turbidity sensor to monitor the water clarity, helping to maintain a clean and healthy aquatic environment.

This smart fish tank combines automation and environmental monitoring to enhance fish care and reduce maintenance efforts.
